## Feedback Loop Architecture

The Mastra feedback architecture implements a multi-layered approach to ensure comprehensive coverage across all system components.

```typescript
export interface FeedbackLoopArchitecture {
  feedbackSources: {
    userExplicit: FeedbackSourceConfiguration;
    userImplicit: FeedbackSourceConfiguration;
    systemMetrics: FeedbackSourceConfiguration;
    agentSelfAssessment: FeedbackSourceConfiguration;
    expertReview: FeedbackSourceConfiguration;
  };
  
  processingPipeline: {
    collection: FeedbackCollectionSystem;
    aggregation: FeedbackAggregationSystem;
    analysis: FeedbackAnalysisSystem;
    prioritization: FeedbackPrioritizationSystem;
    implementation: FeedbackImplementationSystem;
    validation: FeedbackValidationSystem;
  };
  
  improvementCycles: {
    rapid: ImprovementCycleConfiguration;
    standard: ImprovementCycleConfiguration;
    major: ImprovementCycleConfiguration;
  };
}

interface FeedbackSourceConfiguration {
  enabled: boolean;
  collectionMechanisms: string[];
  samplingStrategy: SamplingStrategy;
  dataSchema: Schema;
  privacyControls: PrivacyConfiguration;
  weightInAggregation: number;
}

interface ImprovementCycleConfiguration {
  frequency: string;
  scope: string[];
  approvalProcess: string;
  rolloutStrategy: string;
  rollbackCriteria: string[];
  successMetrics: string[];
}
```

### Closed-Loop System Design

The Mastra feedback system is designed as a closed-loop system with specific pathways for different types of improvements:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Feedback Collection] --> B[Analysis & Prioritization]
    B --> C[Improvement Design]
    C --> D[Implementation]
    D --> E[Validation]
    E --> F{Meets Criteria?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Full Deployment]
    F -->|No| H[Refinement]
    H --> C
    G --> I[Monitoring]
    I --> A
```

### Integration Points

The feedback loops are integrated throughout the Mastra architecture:

1. **Agent Level**: Individual agent performance and behavior
2. **Pipeline Level**: Request processing and workflow optimization
3. **System Level**: Overall platform capabilities and limitations
4. **Ecosystem Level**: Integration with external systems and environments

## User Feedback Collection Mechanisms

Mastra implements multiple mechanisms to collect comprehensive user feedback while maintaining a seamless user experience.

```typescript
export interface ExplicitFeedbackChannels {
  inlineRatings: {
    enabled: boolean;
    scale: number;
    placement: string;
    triggerConditions: string[];
  };
  
  detailedSurveys: {
    enabled: boolean;
    frequency: string;
    targeting: string;
    questions: Array<{
      type: string;
      content: string;
      conditionalDisplay: string;
    }>;
  };
