# MCP Tool Management

## 1. Introduction to MCP Tool Management

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) Tool Management system in Flame Agent Studio provides a dynamic, flexible framework for managing external tools that agents can use. This system enables the registration, validation, configuration, and runtime management of MCP tools from various sources.

MCP tools extend the capabilities of agents by providing access to external services, APIs, and functionality. These tools can range from simple utilities to complex integrations with third-party systems. The Tool Management system ensures that these tools are properly registered, validated, and made available to agents in a controlled and secure manner.

Key aspects of the MCP Tool Management system include:

- **Dynamic Tool Discovery**: Tools can be discovered and registered at runtime
- **Schema Validation**: Tool schemas are validated to ensure compatibility
- **State Management**: Tool states (enabled/disabled, connected/disconnected) are tracked
- **Configuration Management**: Tool configurations are stored and managed
- **Security Controls**: Access to tools is controlled based on permissions
- **UI Integration**: Tools can be managed through both UI and natural language prompts

This document outlines the architecture, database schema, processes, and best practices for the MCP Tool Management system in Flame Agent Studio.

## 2. System Architecture

The MCP Tool Management system follows a modular architecture that integrates with both the Flame Agent Studio UI and the Mastra agent system. The architecture is designed to be flexible, scalable, and secure.

### Key Components

#### Tool Manager

The Tool Manager is the central component responsible for managing the lifecycle of MCP tools. It handles:

- Tool registration and discovery
- Tool validation and verification
- Tool configuration management
- Tool state management
- Database interactions for persistence

#### MCP Client

The MCP Client handles the communication with external MCP servers. It is responsible for:

- Establishing connections to MCP servers
- Discovering available tools from servers
- Executing tool calls
- Handling authentication and security
- Managing connection states

#### Tool Registry

The Tool Registry maintains a catalog of all available tools and their metadata. It provides:

- A searchable index of tools
- Tool schemas and documentation
- Tool categorization and tagging
- Tool versioning information

#### PostgreSQL Database

The PostgreSQL database stores all persistent data related to tool management, including:

- Tool configurations
- Tool states
- Tool schemas (using JSON/JSONB columns)
- User preferences and permissions
- Historical usage data

#### Orchestrator Agent

The Orchestrator Agent serves as the interface between the user's natural language requests and the tool management system. It:

- Interprets user requests related to tool management
- Executes appropriate tool management actions
- Provides feedback on tool operations
- Manages tool execution in response to user tasks

### Communication Flow

    %% Tool Discovery Flow
    User->>UI: Request to add new MCP server
    UI->>Manager: Register server request
    Manager->>Client: Connect to server
    Client->>Server: Request available tools
    Server-->>Client: Return tool definitions
    Client-->>Manager: Provide tool definitions
    Manager->>DB: Store tool metadata
    Manager-->>UI: Update UI with new tools
    
    %% Tool Configuration Flow
    User->>UI: Configure tool settings
    UI->>Manager: Update tool configuration
    Manager->>DB: Store updated configuration
    Manager-->>UI: Confirm configuration saved
    
    %% Tool Usage via Natural Language
    User->>Agent: "Enable the weather tool"
    Agent->>Manager: Request to enable tool
    Manager->>DB: Update tool state
    Manager->>Client: Update client configuration
    Client->>Server: Verify tool availability
    Server-->>Client: Confirm tool available
    Client-->>Manager: Tool ready for use
    Manager-->>Agent: Tool enabled successfully
    Agent-->>User: "Weather tool has been enabled"
```

This architecture enables seamless integration between the UI-based management and natural language-based management of MCP tools, providing users with multiple ways to interact with and configure the system.

## 3. Database Schema

The MCP Tool Management system uses PostgreSQL to store all persistent data related to tools, servers, configurations, and states. The database schema is designed to be flexible, extensible, and efficient for querying.

    UNIQUE(user_id, tool_id)
);
```

### Indexes

To optimize query performance, the following indexes are recommended:

```sql
-- MCP_SERVERS indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_mcp_servers_enabled ON mcp_servers(enabled);
CREATE INDEX idx_mcp_servers_connection_status ON mcp_servers(connection_status);

-- MCP_TOOLS indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_mcp_tools_server_id ON mcp_tools(server_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_mcp_tools_enabled ON mcp_tools(enabled);
CREATE INDEX idx_mcp_tools_status ON mcp_tools(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_mcp_tools_tool_id ON mcp_tools(tool_id);

-- TOOL_TAGS indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_tool_tags_tag ON tool_tags(tag);

-- TOOL_VALIDATIONS indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_tool_validations_tool_id ON tool_validations(tool_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_tool_validations_success ON tool_validations(success);

-- TOOL_USAGE_LOGS indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_tool_usage_logs_tool_id ON tool_usage_logs(tool_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_tool_usage_logs_user_id ON tool_usage_logs(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_tool_usage_logs_used_at ON tool_usage_logs(used_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_tool_usage_logs_success ON tool_usage_logs(success);

-- USER_TOOL_PERMISSIONS indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_user_tool_permissions_user_id ON user_tool_permissions(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_tool_permissions_tool_id ON user_tool_permissions(tool_id);
```

### JSONB Columns

The schema makes extensive use of JSONB columns for flexibility and extensibility:

1. **connection_config (mcp_servers)**: Stores server-specific connection parameters

   ```json
   {
     "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer token123"},
     "timeout": 30000,
     "retries": 3,
     "env": {"API_KEY": "abc123"}
   }
   ```

2. **schema (mcp_tools)**: Stores the JSON Schema of the tool

   ```json
   {
     "name": "weather",
     "description": "Get weather information for a location",
     "parameters": {
       "type": "object",
       "properties": {
         "location": {
           "type": "string",
           "description": "City name or coordinates"
         },
         "units": {
           "type": "string",
           "enum": ["metric", "imperial"],
           "default": "metric"
         }
       },
       "required": ["location"]
     }
   }
   ```

3. **configuration (mcp_tools)**: Stores user-defined configuration for the tool

   ```json
   {
     "default_location": "New York",
     "preferred_units": "metric",
     "api_key": "user_specific_key"
   }
   ```

4. **validation_results (tool_validations)**: Stores detailed validation results

   ```json
   {
     "schema_valid": true,
     "connection_test": {
       "success": true,
       "latency_ms": 120
     },
     "test_run": {
       "success": true,
       "output_valid": true,
       "duration_ms": 350
     }
   }
   ```

This database schema provides a comprehensive foundation for managing MCP tools, their configurations, states, and usage patterns. The use of JSONB columns allows for flexibility as tool schemas and configurations evolve over time.

## 4. Tool Registration Process

The tool registration process is a critical component of the MCP Tool Management system. It ensures that tools are properly discovered, validated, and integrated into the system. This section outlines the end-to-end process for registering and validating MCP tools.

### Registration Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start([Start]) --> AddServer[Add MCP Server]
    AddServer --> ConnectServer[Connect to Server]
    ConnectServer --> DiscoverTools[Discover Available Tools]
    DiscoverTools --> ValidateTools[Validate Tool Schemas]
    ValidateTools --> StoreMetadata[Store Tool Metadata]
    StoreMetadata --> ConfigureTools[Configure Tools]
    ConfigureTools --> TestTools[Test Tools]
    TestTools --> EnableTools[Enable Tools]
    EnableTools --> End([End])
    
    ValidateTools -- Invalid Schema --> RejectTool[Reject Tool]
    TestTools -- Test Failed --> DisableTool[Disable Tool]
    
    subgraph "Validation Phase"
        ValidateTools
        RejectTool
    end
    
    subgraph "Configuration Phase"
        ConfigureTools
        TestTools
        DisableTool
    end
```

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Adding an MCP Server

The process begins with adding a new MCP server to the system. This can be done through the UI or via natural language prompts to the orchestrator agent.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Agent as Orchestrator Agent
    participant Manager as Tool Manager
    participant DB as Database
    
    User->>Agent: "Add a new MCP server at https://example.com/mcp"
    Agent->>Manager: addMCPServer(url, type, etc.)
    Manager->>DB: Insert server record
    DB-->>Manager: Server ID
    Manager-->>Agent: Server added successfully
    Agent-->>User: "MCP server has been added successfully"
```

Required information for adding a server includes:

- Server URL
- Server type (HTTP, STDIO, custom)
- Authentication details (if required)
- Connection parameters

#### 2. Discovering Available Tools

Once a server is added, the system connects to it and discovers available tools.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Manager as Tool Manager
    participant Client as MCP Client
    participant Server as MCP Server
    participant DB as Database
    
    Manager->>Client: connectToServer(serverId)
    Client->>Server: Connect
    Server-->>Client: Connection established
    Client->>Server: listAvailableTools()
    Server-->>Client: Tool definitions
    Client-->>Manager: Tool definitions
    
    loop For each tool
        Manager->>DB: Check if tool exists
        DB-->>Manager: Tool exists/doesn't exist
        Manager->>DB: Insert/Update tool record
    end
    
    Manager->>DB: Update server status
```

The discovery process captures the following information for each tool:

- Tool ID
- Name and description
- Schema (parameters, return types)
- Version information

#### 3. Validating Tool Schemas

Each discovered tool undergoes schema validation to ensure it conforms to the expected format and contains all required information.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Manager as Tool Manager
    participant Validator as Schema Validator
    participant DB as Database
    
    loop For each tool
        Manager->>Validator: validateSchema(toolSchema)
        Validator-->>Manager: Validation result
        
        alt Schema Valid
            Manager->>DB: Mark tool as valid
        else Schema Invalid
            Manager->>DB: Mark tool as invalid
            Manager->>DB: Store validation errors
        end
    end
```

Validation checks include:

- Schema structure correctness
- Required fields presence
- Data type consistency
- Parameter definitions completeness

#### 4. Tool Testing and Verification

Valid tools undergo testing to verify their functionality before being enabled for use.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Manager as Tool Manager
    participant Client as MCP Client
    participant Server as MCP Server
    participant DB as Database
    
    loop For each valid tool
        Manager->>Client: testTool(toolId, testParams)
        Client->>Server: Execute tool with test parameters
        Server-->>Client: Test result
        Client-->>Manager: Test result
        
        alt Test Successful
            Manager->>DB: Mark tool as verified
            Manager->>DB: Store test results
        else Test Failed
            Manager->>DB: Mark tool as unverified
            Manager->>DB: Store error information
        end
    end
```

Testing involves:

- Executing the tool with sample parameters
- Verifying the response format
- Measuring performance metrics
- Checking error handling

### Automatic vs. Manual Registration

The system supports both automatic and manual registration processes:

#### Automatic Registration

- **Triggered by**: Adding a new server, server reconnection, or scheduled discovery
- **Process**: Automatically discovers, validates, and registers tools
- **Configuration**: Uses default configurations
- **Enablement**: Tools can be auto-enabled based on policy or require manual approval

#### Manual Registration

- **Triggered by**: User request via UI or natural language
- **Process**: User guides the discovery and registration process
- **Configuration**: User provides custom configurations
- **Enablement**: User explicitly enables tools

### Tool Metadata Collection

During registration, the system collects comprehensive metadata about each tool:

1. **Basic Information**:
   - Name, description, version
   - Source server
   - Creation and update timestamps

2. **Schema Information**:
   - Parameter definitions
   - Return type definitions
   - Required vs. optional parameters
   - Default values

3. **Usage Information**:
   - Suggested use cases
   - Example calls
   - Rate limiting information
   - Cost information (if applicable)

4. **Categorization**:
   - Tool category
   - Tags
   - Related tools

This metadata is stored in the database and used for tool discovery, configuration, and usage throughout the system.

## 5. Tool State Management

Effective tool state management is crucial for maintaining a reliable and transparent MCP tool ecosystem. This section describes how the system manages and communicates tool states throughout their lifecycle.

### Tool State Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Discovered
    Discovered --> Validating: Schema Validation
    Validating --> Invalid: Validation Failed
    Validating --> Validated: Validation Successful
    Validated --> Configured: Configuration Added
    Configured --> Testing: Test Execution
    Testing --> Failed: Test Failed
    Testing --> Verified: Test Successful
    Verified --> Enabled: User/System Enables
    Enabled --> Disabled: User/System Disables
    Disabled --> Enabled: User/System Re-enables
    
    Enabled --> Connecting: Tool Invocation
    Connecting --> Connected: Connection Successful
    Connected --> Executing: Executing Operation
    Executing --> Completed: Operation Successful
    Executing --> Error: Operation Failed
    Error --> Enabled: Reset State
    Completed --> Enabled: Reset State
    
    Enabled --> Updating: New Version Available
    Updating --> Validated: Update Complete
    
    Invalid --> [*]: Removal
    Failed --> [*]: Removal
    Disabled --> [*]: Removal
```

### Primary Tool States

Tools in the system can exist in the following primary states:

1. **Discovered**: Tool has been found on an MCP server but not yet validated
2. **Validated**: Tool schema has been validated and is structurally correct
3. **Configured**: Tool has been configured with necessary parameters
4. **Verified**: Tool has been tested and confirmed to work correctly
5. **Enabled**: Tool is available for use by agents and users
6. **Disabled**: Tool exists but is not available for use
7. **Connecting**: Tool is in the process of establishing a connection
8. **Connected**: Tool has established a connection and is ready for execution
9. **Executing**: Tool is currently executing an operation
10. **Completed**: Tool has successfully completed an operation
11. **Error**: Tool encountered an error during execution
12. **Updating**: Tool is being updated to a new version

### State Transitions

State transitions occur in response to various events:

| Current State | Event | Next State | Description |
|--------------|-------|------------|-------------|
| Discovered | Validation Start | Validating | System begins validating tool schema |
| Validating | Validation Success | Validated | Schema validation completed successfully |
| Validating | Validation Failure | Invalid | Schema validation failed |
| Validated | Configuration Added | Configured | User or system adds configuration |
| Configured | Test Start | Testing | System begins testing the tool |
| Testing | Test Success | Verified | Tool testing completed successfully |
| Testing | Test Failure | Failed | Tool testing failed |
| Verified | Enable Command | Enabled | User or system enables the tool |
| Enabled | Disable Command | Disabled | User or system disables the tool |
| Disabled | Enable Command | Enabled | User or system re-enables the tool |
| Enabled | Tool Invocation | Connecting | Tool is invoked and begins connecting |
| Connecting | Connection Success | Connected | Connection established successfully |
| Connected | Operation Start | Executing | Tool begins executing operation |
| Executing | Operation Success | Completed | Operation completed successfully |
| Executing | Operation Failure | Error | Operation failed |
| Completed | Reset | Enabled | Tool state is reset after completion |
| Error | Reset | Enabled | Tool state is reset after error |
| Enabled | Update Available | Updating | New version of tool is available |

### State Storage and Persistence

Tool states are stored in the database with the following considerations:

1. **Current State**: Stored in the `status` field of the `mcp_tools` table
2. **State History**: Recorded in a separate `tool_state_history` table for auditing
3. **Transition Metadata**: Each state transition includes:
   - Timestamp
   - Previous state
   - New state
   - Reason for transition
   - Actor (user or system) that triggered the transition

```sql
CREATE TABLE tool_state_history (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    tool_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES mcp_tools(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    previous_state TEXT NOT NULL,
    new_state TEXT NOT NULL,
    transition_time TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    reason TEXT,
    actor TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'system' or 'user:uuid'
    metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}'
);
```

### Runtime vs. Persistent States

The system distinguishes between two types of states:

1. **Persistent States**: Long-lived states stored in the database (e.g., Enabled, Disabled, Verified)
2. **Runtime States**: Temporary states during tool execution (e.g., Connecting, Executing, Completed)

Runtime states are tracked in memory during tool execution and may be persisted to the database for monitoring and debugging purposes, but they automatically transition back to a persistent state after completion.

### State Communication

Tool state changes are communicated to various system components:

```mermaid

    StateChange[State Change Event] --> DB[Database Update]
    StateChange --> EventBus[Event Bus]
    
    EventBus --> UI[UI Notification]
    EventBus --> Agent[Agent Notification]
    EventBus --> Logger[System Logger]
    EventBus --> Metrics[Metrics Collector]
    
    UI --> UserNotification[User Notification]
    Agent --> AgentBehavior[Agent Behavior Adjustment]
    Logger --> AuditLog[Audit Log]
    Metrics --> Dashboard[Monitoring Dashboard]
```

#### Communication Channels

1. **UI Notifications**: State changes are reflected in the UI with appropriate visual indicators
2. **Agent Notifications**: Agents are informed of tool state changes to adjust their behavior
3. **Event Bus**: A central event bus publishes state change events for subscribers
4. **Webhooks**: External systems can subscribe to state change notifications
5. **Logs**: State changes are recorded in system logs for debugging and auditing

### State Monitoring and Recovery

The system includes mechanisms for monitoring tool states and recovering from error conditions:

1. **Health Checks**: Periodic checks verify that tools are in the expected state
2. **Auto-Recovery**: Automatic recovery attempts for tools in error states
3. **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent repeated failures by temporarily disabling problematic tools
4. **Fallbacks**: Define alternative tools to use when a preferred tool is unavailable

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Monitor as State Monitor
    participant Manager as Tool Manager
    participant DB as Database
    
    loop Every monitoring interval
        Monitor->>DB: Get tools in error state
        DB-->>Monitor: List of error tools
        
        loop For each error tool
            Monitor->>Manager: attemptRecovery(toolId)
            Manager->>DB: Update tool state
            
            alt Recovery Successful
                Manager-->>Monitor: Recovery successful
                Monitor->>DB: Reset error count
            else Recovery Failed
                Manager-->>Monitor: Recovery failed
                Monitor->>DB: Increment error count
                
                alt Max Errors Exceeded
                    Monitor->>Manager: disableTool(toolId)
                    Manager->>DB: Set tool state to Disabled
                end
            end
        end
    end
```

### User Control of Tool States

Users can control tool states through various interfaces:

1. **UI Controls**: Enable/disable toggles and status indicators in the UI
2. **Natural Language Commands**: Commands to the orchestrator agent to change tool states
3. **API Endpoints**: Programmatic control of tool states via API
4. **Automation Rules**: Conditional rules for automatic state changes

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Agent as Orchestrator Agent
    participant Manager as Tool Manager
    participant DB as Database
    
    User->>Agent: "Disable the weather tool"
    Agent->>Manager: disableTool("weather")
    Manager->>DB: Update tool state
    DB-->>Manager: Confirmation
    Manager-->>Agent: Tool disabled
    Agent-->>User: "Weather tool has been disabled"
```

### State-Based Access Control

Tool states influence access control decisions:

1. **Enabled Tools**: Available to all authorized users and agents
2. **Disabled Tools**: Not available for use, but visible to administrators
3. **Error State Tools**: May be available with warnings or restricted to certain users
4. **Updating Tools**: Temporarily unavailable during updates

Access control policies can be defined based on tool states, user roles, and other contextual factors.

## 6. Tool Schema Validation

Tool schema validation is a critical process that ensures MCP tools conform to expected formats and standards. This section details the validation process, schema requirements, and handling of validation results.

### JSON Schema Standard

The MCP Tool Management system uses the JSON Schema standard (Draft 2020-12) to validate tool definitions. This provides a robust framework for validating the structure and content of tool schemas.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    ToolSchema[Tool Schema] --> Validator[JSON Schema Validator]
    MCPStandard[MCP Standard Schema] --> Validator
    Validator --> ValidationResult[Validation Result]
    
    ValidationResult -- Valid --> StoreSchema[Store Schema]
    ValidationResult -- Invalid --> RejectSchema[Reject Schema]
    
    StoreSchema --> DB[(Database)]
    RejectSchema --> ErrorLog[Error Log]
```

### MCP Tool Schema Requirements

A valid MCP tool schema must include the following components:

#### Basic Structure

```json
{
  "name": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": { ... },
    "required": [ ... ]
  }
}
```

#### Required Fields

1. **name**: A unique identifier for the tool
2. **description**: A clear description of the tool's purpose and functionality
3. **parameters**: An object defining the input parameters for the tool

#### Parameter Properties

Each parameter must include:

1. **type**: The data type (string, number, boolean, object, array)
2. **description**: A description of the parameter's purpose
3. **required** (optional): Whether the parameter is required

Additional properties may include:

- **enum**: List of allowed values
- **default**: Default value if not provided
- **minimum/maximum**: Range constraints for numeric values
- **pattern**: Regex pattern for string validation
- **format**: Specific format (e.g., date-time, email, uri)

### Validation Process

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as MCP Client
    participant Validator as Schema Validator
    participant DB as Database
    
    Client->>Validator: validateToolSchema(schema)
    
    Validator->>Validator: Check basic structure
    Validator->>Validator: Validate required fields
    Validator->>Validator: Validate parameter definitions
    Validator->>Validator: Check for security issues
    
    alt Schema Valid
        Validator-->>Client: Validation successful
        Client->>DB: Store validated schema
    else Schema Invalid
        Validator-->>Client: Validation failed with errors
        Client->>DB: Log validation errors
    end
```

The validation process includes multiple checks:

1. **Structural Validation**: Ensures the schema follows the required structure
2. **Field Validation**: Verifies all required fields are present and correctly formatted
3. **Parameter Validation**: Validates parameter definitions and constraints
4. **Security Validation**: Checks for potential security issues in the schema
5. **Compatibility Validation**: Ensures compatibility with the MCP standard

### Schema Evolution and Versioning

Tool schemas can evolve over time. The system handles schema evolution through versioning:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    OriginalSchema[Original Schema v1] --> SchemaUpdate[Schema Update]
    SchemaUpdate --> NewSchema[New Schema v2]
    
    NewSchema --> VersionCheck{Breaking Change?}
    VersionCheck -- Yes --> MajorVersion[Increment Major Version]
    VersionCheck -- No --> MinorVersion[Increment Minor Version]
    
    MajorVersion --> ValidateNew[Validate New Schema]
    MinorVersion --> ValidateNew
    
    ValidateNew --> StoreVersioned[Store Versioned Schema]
    StoreVersioned --> UpdateTools[Update Tool References]
```

#### Versioning Rules

1. **Major Version Change**: Required for breaking changes (e.g., removing parameters, changing types)
2. **Minor Version Change**: For non-breaking changes (e.g., adding optional parameters, extending descriptions)
3. **Patch Version Change**: For documentation updates or clarifications with no functional changes

### Schema Storage

Validated schemas are stored in the database with version information:

```sql
CREATE TABLE tool_schemas (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    tool_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES mcp_tools(id),
    version TEXT NOT NULL,
    schema JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    is_current BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
    UNIQUE(tool_id, version)
);
```

### Validation Error Handling

When validation fails, the system provides detailed error information:

```json
{
  "valid": false,
  "errors": [
    {
      "path": "parameters.properties.location",
      "message": "Missing required property: description",
      "severity": "error"
    },
    {
      "path": "parameters.required",
      "message": "Array expected",
      "severity": "error"
    }
  ],
  "warnings": [
    {
      "path": "description",
      "message": "Description is too short",
      "severity": "warning"
    }
  ]
}
```

Errors are categorized by severity:

1. **Critical**: Prevents the tool from being registered
2. **Error**: Requires fixing before the tool can be enabled
3. **Warning**: Suggests improvements but doesn't block registration
4. **Info**: Informational messages for best practices

### Schema Validation Implementation

The schema validation is implemented using the following components:

```typescript
interface ValidationResult {
  valid: boolean;
  errors?: ValidationError[];
  warnings?: ValidationWarning[];
}

interface ValidationError {
  path: string;
  message: string;
  severity: 'critical' | 'error' | 'warning' | 'info';
  code?: string;
}

class SchemaValidator {
  validateToolSchema(schema: any): ValidationResult {
    // Implementation details
  }
  
  validateParameterDefinitions(parameters: any): ValidationResult {
    // Implementation details
  }
  
  checkSecurityIssues(schema: any): ValidationResult {
    // Implementation details
  }
}
```

### Custom Validation Rules

Beyond standard JSON Schema validation, the system implements custom validation rules specific to MCP tools:

1. **Parameter Naming**: Enforces consistent parameter naming conventions
2. **Description Quality**: Ensures descriptions are clear and comprehensive
3. **Security Checks**: Identifies potential security risks in parameter definitions
4. **Best Practices**: Validates adherence to MCP tool development best practices

### Schema Documentation Generation

Validated schemas are used to automatically generate documentation for tools:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    ValidatedSchema[Validated Schema] --> DocGenerator[Documentation Generator]
    DocGenerator --> MarkdownDocs[Markdown Documentation]
    DocGenerator --> APIReference[API Reference]
    DocGenerator --> ExampleCode[Example Code]
```

The documentation includes:

1. **Tool Overview**: Name, description, and purpose
2. **Parameter Reference**: Detailed information about each parameter
3. **Usage Examples**: Example calls with parameters
4. **Return Value Documentation**: Description of expected return values
5. **Error Handling**: Common errors and how to address them

### Schema Testing

Validated schemas undergo testing to ensure they work as expected:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Tester as Schema Tester
    participant Client as MCP Client
    participant Server as MCP Server
    
    Tester->>Client: testSchema(schema, testCases)
    
    loop For each test case
        Client->>Server: Execute tool with test parameters
        Server-->>Client: Response
        Client->>Tester: Validate response against expected result
    end
    
    Tester-->>Tester: Generate test report
```

Test cases cover:

1. **Valid Inputs**: Testing with valid parameter combinations
2. **Invalid Inputs**: Testing with invalid parameters to verify error handling
3. **Edge Cases**: Testing boundary conditions and special cases
4. **Performance**: Measuring response times and resource usage

This comprehensive validation process ensures that all tools in the system are well-defined, secure, and reliable, providing a solid foundation for the MCP Tool Management system.

## 7. User Interaction via Prompts

The MCP Tool Management system provides a natural language interface for users to manage tools through the orchestrator agent. This section describes how users can interact with the system using natural language prompts.

### Natural Language Command Processing

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    UserPrompt[User Prompt] --> OrchestratorAgent[Orchestrator Agent]
    OrchestratorAgent --> IntentRecognition[Intent Recognition]
    IntentRecognition --> EntityExtraction[Entity Extraction]
    EntityExtraction --> CommandMapping[Command Mapping]
    CommandMapping --> ToolManager[Tool Manager]
    ToolManager --> Action[Execute Action]
    Action --> Response[Generate Response]
    Response --> User[User Feedback]
```

The process of handling natural language commands involves:

1. **Intent Recognition**: Identifying the user's intention (e.g., add, remove, enable, disable)
2. **Entity Extraction**: Extracting relevant entities (e.g., tool names, server URLs)
3. **Command Mapping**: Mapping the intent and entities to specific system commands
4. **Action Execution**: Executing the mapped command through the Tool Manager
5. **Response Generation**: Providing feedback to the user about the action's result

### Supported Command Categories

The system supports several categories of natural language commands:

#### Server Management Commands

| Intent | Example Prompt | Action |

    Manager-->>Agent: {success: true, serverId: "uuid"}
    Agent-->>User: "I've added the Weather API MCP server at https://example.com/mcp. Would you like me to discover available tools on this server?"
```

### Contextual Understanding

The system maintains conversation context to support natural interactions:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Agent as Orchestrator Agent
    participant Context as Context Manager
    participant Manager as Tool Manager
    
    User->>Agent: "Show me all available MCP servers"
    Agent->>Manager: listMCPServers()
    Manager-->>Agent: [List of servers]
    Agent-->>User: "Here are the available MCP servers: [list]"
    
    User->>Agent: "Enable the first one"
    Agent->>Context: Get context from previous interaction
    Context-->>Agent: {previous_servers: [List of servers]}
    Agent->>Manager: enableMCPServer(previous_servers[0].id)
    Manager-->>Agent: {success: true}
    Agent-->>User: "I've enabled the server 'Example Server'"
```

### Disambiguation and Clarification

When prompts are ambiguous, the system asks for clarification:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Agent as Orchestrator Agent
    participant Manager as Tool Manager
    
    User->>Agent: "Disable the weather tool"
    Agent->>Manager: findTools({name: "weather"})
    Manager-->>Agent: [Multiple matching tools]
    
    Agent-->>User: "I found multiple weather tools. Did you mean:\n1. OpenWeather API\n2. Weather.gov\n3. AccuWeather"
    User->>Agent: "The second one"
    
    Agent->>Manager: disableTool(tools[1].id)
    Manager-->>Agent: {success: true}
    Agent-->>User: "I've disabled the Weather.gov tool"
```

### Prompt Templates

The system recognizes various phrasings for the same intent:

#### Adding a Server

- "Add a new MCP server at [URL]"
- "Connect to the MCP server at [URL]"
- "Register the [NAME] MCP server at [URL]"
- "I want to add a new tool server at [URL]"
- "Set up a connection to the MCP server at [URL]"

#### Enabling/Disabling Tools

- "Enable the [TOOL] tool"
- "Turn on [TOOL]"
- "Make [TOOL] available"
- "Activate the [TOOL] tool"
- "Disable [TOOL]"
- "Turn off the [TOOL] tool"
- "Deactivate [TOOL]"

### Feedback and Confirmation

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Agent as Orchestrator Agent
    participant Manager as Tool Manager
    
    User->>Agent: "Enable the translation tool"
    Agent->>Manager: enableTool("translation")
    
    alt Success
        Manager-->>Agent: {success: true}
        Agent-->>User: "✅ The translation tool has been enabled and is ready to use."
    else Failure
        Manager-->>Agent: {success: false, error: "Tool not found"}
        Agent-->>User: "❌ I couldn't find a tool named 'translation'. Would you like to see a list of available tools?"
    end
```

### Progressive Disclosure

The system uses progressive disclosure to avoid overwhelming users:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Agent as Orchestrator Agent
    
    User->>Agent: "What can I do with MCP tools?"
    Agent-->>User: "You can manage MCP servers and tools. For example, you can add servers, discover tools, enable/disable tools, and configure them. What would you like to do?"
    
    User->>Agent: "How do I add a server?"
    Agent-->>User: "To add a server, you can say something like 'Add a new MCP server at `https://example.com/mcp`'. Would you like me to guide you through adding a server?"
    
    User->>Agent: "Yes please"
    Agent-->>User: "Great! Let's add a server. First, what's the URL of the MCP server you want to add?"
```

### Guided Workflows

For complex operations, the system offers guided workflows:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Agent as Orchestrator Agent
    participant Manager as Tool Manager
    
    User->>Agent: "I want to set up a new tool"
    Agent-->>User: "I can help you set up a new tool. Do you already have an MCP server, or do you need to add one first?"
    
    User->>Agent: "I need to add one"
    Agent-->>User: "What's the URL of the MCP server?"
    
    User->>Agent: "https://example.com/mcp"
    Agent-->>User: "What would you like to name this server?"
    
    User->>Agent: "Example API"
    Agent->>Manager: addMCPServer("https://example.com/mcp", "Example API")
    Manager-->>Agent: {success: true, serverId: "uuid"}
    
    Agent-->>User: "Great! I've added the Example API server. Would you like me to discover available tools on this server?"
    
    User->>Agent: "Yes"
    Agent->>Manager: discoverTools("uuid")
    Manager-->>Agent: {tools: [List of discovered tools]}
    
    Agent-->>User: "I found these tools: [list]. Which ones would you like to enable?"
```

### Error Handling

The system provides helpful error messages and recovery suggestions:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Agent as Orchestrator Agent
    participant Manager as Tool Manager
    
    User->>Agent: "Add a server at invalid-url"
    Agent->>Manager: validateServerURL("invalid-url")
    Manager-->>Agent: {valid: false, reason: "Invalid URL format"}
    
    Agent-->>User: "The URL 'invalid-url' doesn't appear to be valid. URLs should start with http:// or https:// and include a domain name. For example: `https://example.com/mcp`"
    
    User->>Agent: "Add a server at `https://example.com/mcp`"
    Agent->>Manager: addMCPServer("https://example.com/mcp")
    Manager-->>Agent: {success: false, error: "Connection failed", details: "Timeout after 30s"}
    
    Agent-->>User: "I couldn't connect to the server at `https://example.com/mcp`. The connection timed out after 30 seconds. Please check that the server is running and accessible, or try again later."
```

### Prompt-Based Configuration

Users can configure tools using natural language:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Agent as Orchestrator Agent
    participant Manager as Tool Manager
    participant DB as Database
    
    User->>Agent: "Configure the weather tool to use Celsius"
    Agent->>Manager: findTool("weather")
    Manager-->>Agent: {tool: weatherTool}
    
    Agent->>Manager: getToolConfiguration(weatherTool.id)
    Manager-->>Agent: {configuration: {units: "imperial", ...}}
    
    Agent->>Manager: updateToolConfiguration(weatherTool.id, {units: "metric"})
    Manager->>DB: Update configuration
    DB-->>Manager: Success
    Manager-->>Agent: {success: true}
    
    Agent-->>User: "I've updated the weather tool to use metric units (Celsius)."
```

### Personalization and Preferences

The system remembers user preferences for tool management:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Agent as Orchestrator Agent
    participant Prefs as Preference Manager
    participant Manager as Tool Manager
    
    User->>Agent: "Always enable new weather tools automatically"
    Agent->>Prefs: setPreference("auto_enable_category", "weather", true)
    Prefs-->>Agent: {success: true}
    
    Agent-->>User: "I'll automatically enable new weather tools when they're discovered."
    
    Note over Agent,Manager: Later, during tool discovery
    
    Manager->>Agent: toolDiscovered({name: "New Weather Tool", category: "weather"})
    Agent->>Prefs: getPreference("auto_enable_category", "weather")
    Prefs-->>Agent: {value: true}
    
    Agent->>Manager: enableTool("New Weather Tool")
    Manager-->>Agent: {success: true}
    
    Agent-->>User: "I've discovered and automatically enabled the 'New Weather Tool' based on your preferences."
```

These natural language interaction capabilities make the MCP Tool Management system accessible to users without requiring technical knowledge of the underlying systems, while still providing the full power and flexibility of the tool management functionality.
