## Introduction

Prometheus Studio is currently built using Electron, a popular framework for developing cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies. This document explores the feasibility, advantages, challenges, and implementation strategy for migrating Prometheus Studio from Electron to Flutter, Google's UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications.

Flutter, initially focused on mobile development, has expanded to support desktop platforms (Windows, macOS, and Linux). This analysis will provide a comprehensive evaluation of how Prometheus Studio could be reimplemented using Flutter, including the technical approach, challenges, and benefits.

## Understanding Flutter for Desktop

### What is Flutter?

Flutter is an open-source UI toolkit created by Google for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. It uses the Dart programming language and provides a rich set of pre-designed widgets that follow Material Design and Cupertino (iOS) style guidelines.

Key characteristics of Flutter include:

1. **Single Codebase**: Flutter allows developers to maintain a single codebase for multiple platforms, reducing development time and effort.

2. **Native Performance**: Flutter applications are compiled to native code, resulting in high-performance applications without the overhead of a web browser engine.

3. **Rich Widget Library**: Flutter provides a comprehensive set of customizable widgets for building complex UIs.

4. **Hot Reload**: Flutter's hot reload feature allows developers to see changes in real-time without restarting the application, speeding up the development process.

### Flutter for Desktop Status

Flutter's support for desktop platforms has evolved significantly:

1. **Official Support**: Flutter officially supports Windows, macOS, and Linux desktop platforms.

2. **Maturity Level**: While Flutter for desktop is production-ready, it's still evolving compared to its mobile counterparts. Some platform-specific features may require additional plugins or custom implementations.

3. **Community and Ecosystem**: The Flutter community has developed numerous plugins for desktop-specific functionality, though not all mobile plugins are compatible with desktop platforms.

### Key Desktop Features

1. **Window Management**: Flutter provides APIs for controlling window size, position, and state.

2. **System Tray**: Through community plugins like `tray_manager`, Flutter applications can integrate with the system tray.

3. **Multiple Windows**: Flutter supports creating and managing multiple windows through plugins like `desktop_multi_window`.

4. **WebView**: WebView support for desktop is available through plugins like `desktop_webview_window` and `webview_cef`, though with varying levels of maturity across platforms.

5. **File System Access**: Flutter provides comprehensive file system access on desktop platforms.

6. **Native Integration**: Flutter applications can access native APIs through platform channels and FFI (Foreign Function Interface).

## Technical Implementation Plan

### UI Migration

The UI migration would involve reimplementing the React components as Flutter widgets:

1. **Widget Structure**:
   - Create a widget hierarchy that mirrors the current React component structure
   - Implement Material Design or custom design system

```dart
// Example of a Flutter widget implementation
class MyComponent extends StatelessWidget {
  final String title;
  final String content;
  
  const MyComponent({
    Key? key,
    required this.title,
    required this.content,
  }) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      decoration: BoxDecoration(
        color: Colors.white,
        borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8.0),
        boxShadow: [
          BoxShadow(
            color: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.1),
            blurRadius: 4.0,
            offset: const Offset(0, 2),
          ),
        ],
      ),
      child: Column(
        crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
        children: [
          Text(
            title,
            style: const TextStyle(
              fontSize: 18.0,
              fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
            ),
          ),
          const SizedBox(height: 8.0),
          Text(content),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

2. **State Management**:
   - Implement state management using Flutter solutions like Provider, Riverpod, or Bloc
   - Create a data flow architecture similar to the current Redux implementation

```dart
// Example of a simple state management implementation with Provider
class AppState extends ChangeNotifier {
  String _currentTheme = 'light';
  
  String get currentTheme => _currentTheme;
  
  void setTheme(String theme) {
    _currentTheme = theme;
    notifyListeners();
  }
}

// Usage in widget
Consumer<AppState>(
  builder: (context, appState, child) {
    return ThemeProvider(
      theme: appState.currentTheme,
      child: child!,
    );
  },
  child: const MyApp(),
)
```

### WebView Implementation

Implementing WebView functionality would be one of the most challenging aspects of the migration:

1. **WebView Container**:
   - Use `desktop_webview_window` or `webview_cef` plugin for WebView support
   - Create a custom container for managing multiple WebViews

```dart
// Example of a WebView container implementation
class FlutterWebViewContainer extends StatefulWidget {
  final String appId;
  final String url;
  final Function(String) onSetRefCallback;
  final Function(String) onLoadedCallback;
  final Function(String, String) onNavigateCallback;
  
  const FlutterWebViewContainer({
    Key? key,
    required this.appId,
    required this.url,
    required this.onSetRefCallback,
    required this.onLoadedCallback,
    required this.onNavigateCallback,
  }) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  _FlutterWebViewContainerState createState() => _FlutterWebViewContainerState();
}

class _FlutterWebViewContainerState extends State<FlutterWebViewContainer> {
  late WebViewController controller;
  
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize WebView
    _initWebView();
  }
  
  Future<void> _initWebView() async {
    // Implementation depends on the WebView plugin used
  }
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      // WebView implementation
    );
  }
}
```

2. **Z-order Management**:
   - Implement custom Z-order management for overlapping WebViews
   - Use Flutter's widget tree and Stack widget for proper layering

```dart
// Example of Z-order management with Stack
Stack(
  children: [
    // Lower Z-index WebViews
    Positioned(
      left: webView1Bounds.left,
      top: webView1Bounds.top,
      width: webView1Bounds.width,
      height: webView1Bounds.height,
      child: WebView1Widget(),
    ),
    // Higher Z-index WebViews
    Positioned(
      left: webView2Bounds.left,
      top: webView2Bounds.top,
      width: webView2Bounds.width,
      height: webView2Bounds.height,
      child: WebView2Widget(),
    ),
  ],
)
```

### Service Implementation

The service layer would be reimplemented in Dart:

1. **Window Management**:
   - Use Flutter's window management APIs
   - Implement custom window behavior

```dart
// Example of window management service
class WindowService {
  static final WindowService _instance = WindowService._internal();
  
  factory WindowService() {
    return _instance;
  }
  
  WindowService._internal();
  
  Future<void> createMainWindow() async {
    // Implementation using Flutter window APIs
  }
  
  Future<void> showMainWindow() async {
    // Implementation
  }
  
  Future<void> hideMainWindow() async {
    // Implementation
  }
  
  // Other window management methods
}
```

2. **System Tray**:
   - Use the `tray_manager` plugin for system tray integration

```dart
// Example of system tray service
class TrayService {
  static final TrayService _instance = TrayService._internal();
  
  factory TrayService() {
    return _instance;
  }
  
  TrayService._internal();
  
  Future<void> initialize() async {
    await trayManager.setIcon('assets/tray_icon.png');
    await trayManager.setToolTip('Prometheus Studio');
    
    final menu = Menu(
      items: [
        MenuItem(
          label: 'Show',
          onClick: (_) async {
            await WindowService().showMainWindow();
          },
        ),
        MenuItem.separator(),
        MenuItem(
          label: 'Quit',
          onClick: (_) async {
            await appWindow.close();
          },
        ),
      ],
    );
    
    await trayManager.setContextMenu(menu);
  }
  
  // Other tray methods
}
```

3. **MCP Integration**:
   - Implement MCP service in Dart
   - Use platform channels or FFI for native integration if needed

```dart
// Example of MCP service
class MCPService {
  static final MCPService _instance = MCPService._internal();
  
  factory MCPService() {
    return _instance;
  }
  
  MCPService._internal();
  
  Future<void> initClient(MCPServer server) async {
    // Implementation
  }
  
  Future<dynamic> callTool(MCPServer server, String name, dynamic args) async {
    // Implementation
  }
  
  // Other MCP methods
}
```

### Platform Integration

Flutter provides several mechanisms for platform integration:

1. **Method Channels**:
   - Use method channels for communication with native code

```dart
// Example of method channel implementation
class NativeIntegration {
  static const MethodChannel _channel = MethodChannel('prometheus_studio/native');
  
  static Future<String> getPlatformVersion() async {
    return await _channel.invokeMethod('getPlatformVersion');
  }
  
  // Other native methods
}
```

2. **FFI (Foreign Function Interface)**:
   - Use FFI for direct integration with native libraries

```dart
// Example of FFI implementation
import 'dart:ffi';
import 'package:ffi/ffi.dart';

// FFI signature
typedef NativeFunction = Int32 Function(Pointer<Utf8> message);
typedef DartFunction = int Function(Pointer<Utf8> message);

class NativeLibrary {
  static final DynamicLibrary _lib = DynamicLibrary.open('native_library.dll');
  
  static final DartFunction _nativeFunction = _lib
      .lookupFunction<NativeFunction, DartFunction>('native_function');
  
  static int callNativeFunction(String message) {
    final messagePointer = message.toNativeUtf8();
    final result = _nativeFunction(messagePointer);
    malloc.free(messagePointer);
    return result;
  }
}
```
