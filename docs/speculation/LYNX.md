## Introduction

Prometheus Studio is currently built using Electron, a popular framework for developing cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies. This document explores the feasibility, advantages, challenges, and implementation strategy for migrating Prometheus Studio from Electron to Lynx/React Lynx, a newer framework developed by ByteDance (the company behind TikTok).

Lynx is ByteDance's open-source UI framework designed for cross-platform application development. While it currently focuses primarily on mobile platforms (Android and iOS) and web, ByteDance has indicated plans to extend the framework to desktop platforms. This analysis will provide a speculative evaluation of how Prometheus Studio could be reimplemented using Lynx/React Lynx, including the technical approach, challenges, and benefits.

## Understanding Lynx and React Lynx

### What is Lynx?

Lynx is ByteDance's open-source UI framework designed for cross-platform application development. It was officially open-sourced in March 2025 and has quickly gained attention in the developer community.

Key characteristics of Lynx include:

1. **Dual-thread Architecture**: Lynx divides JavaScript work between two threads:
   - Main UI thread: Handles UI updates instantly
   - Background thread: Processes business logic and data operations

2. **Framework Agnosticism**: Unlike React Native, which is tightly coupled with React, Lynx is framework-agnostic. While it ships with ReactLynx (a React-compatible layer), it can work with other frontend frameworks like Svelte or Vue.

3. **Native Performance**: Lynx aims to deliver native performance through its custom JavaScript engine and pixel-perfect UI rendering.

4. **CSS-centric Styling**: Lynx uses standard CSS for styling, making it familiar to web developers.

### What is React Lynx?

React Lynx is the React implementation for Lynx, allowing developers to use React's component-based architecture and declarative UI paradigm with Lynx's rendering capabilities. It provides a familiar development experience for React developers while leveraging Lynx's performance benefits.

### Current State of Desktop Support

As of now, Lynx primarily targets mobile platforms (Android and iOS) and web. ByteDance has announced plans to extend the framework to other platforms, including desktop, TV, and IoT devices, but detailed information about the current state of desktop support is limited.

This analysis will consider both the current capabilities of Lynx and its potential future desktop support to evaluate its suitability for Prometheus Studio.

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Frontend Migration

The frontend migration would involve adapting React components to work with React Lynx:

1. **Component Adaptation**:
   - Update imports and component structure
   - Adapt styling from CSS to Lynx's CSS implementation
   - Implement platform-specific behavior

```jsx
// Current Electron/React implementation
import React from 'react';
import './styles.css';

const MyComponent = ({ data }) => {
  return (
    <div className="container">
      <h1>{data.title}</h1>
      <p>{data.content}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

// React Lynx implementation (speculative)
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-lynx';
import styles from './styles';

const MyComponent = ({ data }) => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>{data.title}</Text>
      <Text style={styles.content}>{data.content}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = {
  container: {
    padding: '16px',
    backgroundColor: '#ffffff',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: '24px',
    fontWeight: 'bold',
  },
  content: {
    fontSize: '16px',
  },
};
```

2. **WebContentsView Replacement**:
   - Create a custom component for managing multiple webviews
   - Implement proper positioning and Z-order management

```jsx
// Speculative implementation for a Lynx WebView container
import React, { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import { View, WebView } from 'react-lynx';

const LynxWebViewContainer = ({
  appid,
  url,
  onSetRefCallback,
  onLoadedCallback,
  onNavigateCallback
}) => {
  const containerRef = useRef(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    if (containerRef.current) {
      onSetRefCallback(appid, containerRef.current);
    }
    
    return () => {
      // Cleanup
    };
  }, [appid, onSetRefCallback]);
  
  const handleLoad = () => {
    onLoadedCallback(appid);
  };
  
  const handleNavigate = (event) => {
    onNavigateCallback(appid, event.url);
  };
  
  return (
    <View ref={containerRef} style={{ width: '100%', height: '100%' }}>
      <WebView
        source={{ uri: url }}
        onLoad={handleLoad}
        onNavigate={handleNavigate}
        style={{ flex: 1 }}
      />
    </View>
  );
};
```

### Backend Implementation

The backend implementation would depend on Lynx's desktop capabilities, which are not yet fully documented. Based on Lynx's architecture for mobile and web, we can speculate on potential approaches:

1. **Window Management**:
   - Implement window management using Lynx's native bridges
   - Create a service for managing multiple windows

```javascript
// Speculative implementation for window management
import { NativeWindow } from 'lynx-desktop';

class WindowService {
  constructor() {
    this.windows = new Map();
    this.mainWindow = null;
  }
  
  createMainWindow() {
    if (this.mainWindow && !this.mainWindow.isDestroyed()) {
      this.mainWindow.show();
      return this.mainWindow;
    }
    
    this.mainWindow = new NativeWindow({
      width: 1080,
      height: 670,
      title: 'Prometheus Studio',
      // Other window options
    });
    
    // Set up window events
    this.mainWindow.on('close', this.handleClose);
    
    return this.mainWindow;
  }
  
  // Other window management methods
}
```

2. **System Tray**:
   - Implement system tray functionality using Lynx's native bridges

```javascript
// Speculative implementation for system tray
import { NativeTray } from 'lynx-desktop';

class TrayService {
  constructor() {
    this.tray = new NativeTray({
      icon: 'path/to/icon.png',
      tooltip: 'Prometheus Studio',
    });
    
    this.tray.setMenu([
      { label: 'Show', click: this.handleShow },
      { label: 'Quit', click: this.handleQuit },
    ]);
  }
  
  // Tray event handlers
}
```

3. **IPC Mechanism**:
   - Implement communication between UI and backend using Lynx's messaging system

```javascript
// Speculative implementation for IPC
import { LynxMessaging } from 'lynx-desktop';

// Register message handlers
LynxMessaging.on('window:create', (data, callback) => {
  // Handle window creation
  callback({ success: true });
});

// Send messages from UI to backend
LynxMessaging.send('window:create', { width: 800, height: 600 })
  .then(result => {
    // Handle result
  });
```

### Multiple Webviews Implementation

Implementing multiple webviews would be one of the most challenging aspects, especially given the limited information about Lynx's desktop capabilities:

1. **Potential Approaches**:
   - Use Lynx's WebView component with custom positioning
